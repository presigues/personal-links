# personal-links

check out the updated version here : https://66be3de5a07baf065fff7882--transcendent-druid-4b9623.netlify.app

i wanted to create a linktree or flowcode style link website that looked cool and gave me (much) more customization

you can click each link and it will send you to the personal link said on said button

use this to check out my socials and other stuff, where i can link the website on my bio for said socials.

hope its cool checking out this site and my socials!
